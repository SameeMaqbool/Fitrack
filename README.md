2.select Inspect
3.at the top of the "Inspect" page, to the left of "Elements" is a 
small icon with a laptop and a mobile device titled "toggle device toolbar"

Work in progress...

Fonts importing incorrectly, showing up correct on project but not on Github

Still working on things like the process of making the exercises or selecting different dates on the calander. I plan to do much more with this in the future. If you have any comments, suggestions on what we can do to make this project even better, please feel free to let me know, I'd love to hear your response.

I hope you enjoy an extremely early prototype version of Fitrack!
